<h1>Beginner's HTML5 and CSS3</h1>
    <img src="codes-coding-css-1921326.jpg"/>
    <p> This site was created as an instructional aid for those starting html and css. HTML (hypertext markup language) is primarily used for structuring a web page. Earlier versions of HTML used to style web pages using inline styles. This is no longer the case as more and more programmers are coming to rely on cascading style sheets (CSS) to style their pages.</p>
    <p>CSS is responsible for the look and feel of the site. One can set up the background color, font color, image sizes, font type...etc. through CSS. CSS is able to do this by selecting certain elements of HTML to style. For example, after I changed the background color to black, I targeted the h1 element in CSS and styled it white so it could be visible. The HTML tags that are targeted in this process are also known as CSS selectors.</p> 
    <p>But what happens if you have more than one h1 tag? Take these paragraphs for example, how would you be able to style one paragraph without styling the others? IDs are unique and used to target specific HTML elements that have more than one element. There <strong>cannot</strong> be more than one ID. If you wanted to target a whole group of HTML elements, you would have to group each element under the same class.</p>
    <p>Take a few moments to examine the CSS <a href="helloworld.css">code</a> on this page. You will notice that the background color for the body is set to black (#1a1a1a) by using the body element selector.
