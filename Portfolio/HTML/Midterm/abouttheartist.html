            <div><p>Christian Claudio graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in fine arts animation. He first discovered his love of art in elementary school when he was given a book on how to draw fantasy characters. Claudio would always try to copy the illustrations, slowly mastering the technique and eventually realized how much he enjoyed creating his own works of art. Claudio states, “I started to create my own characters and I realized that creating visual narratives was a source of genuine joy in my life.”</p> 
            <p>He began looking toward other artists as sources for inspiration. Talented artists like <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio" target="_blank">Michelangelo Caravaggio</a> and <a href="http://www.jamesjean.com/" target="_blank">James Jean</a>, two artists with a penchant for creating distinct tones and environments within their work, motivated Claudio to create his own fanciful atmospheres and characters. Claudio states, “My favorite artist is James Jean. The ethereal quality of his work makes me feel so absorbed [that] I could stare for hours. Something about the pensive mood in his art resonates with me. He’s an artist that inspires me.”</p>
            <p>Claudio’s passion for art did not stop at childhood, but grew into a lifelong passion. He found that his experiences in college helped expose and direct him to many different types of artwork. Through college he was able to experience several different mediums to create his work, but found that he particularly enjoyed working with digital painting. “It’s an amazing process because it’s very forgiving,” Claudio explains, “the possibilities are limitless in regards to how much you can manipulate the art.” Claudio’s experience grew exponentially with challenging group projects like his short animation film, “Small Screens” and his recent virtual reality project, “Pacifico”. Claudio took the lead on “Small Screens,” by helping direct his team toward a clear goal.</p></div>
